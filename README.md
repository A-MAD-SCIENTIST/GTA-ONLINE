# GTAOMacro (Forked & Fixed).

This was made to bind in-game options to key bindings. 

One of the biggest two is snacks and body armor for heists.

You can find a VirusTotal scan [here](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/e34be4f70a872885df1c9ac0c2ab427718f23eae462b0dbfe79d025351caad43/detection) :)

Very unlikely to be banned.

# Installation 


Download and extract folders into a folder, i.e, Desktop. 

Run the GTAOMacro.exe as Administrator.

Once done, load up GTA Online.

# Controls 

Activate scripts with the 'END' key - also vice versa.

Common:


Eat snacks = F4


Armor = F5


Buzzard = NUMPAD 0 & NUMPAD 4 (Press simultaneously btw)


Ammo = Numpadsub - 

More can be found in the .ini generated file.


# Issues

When activated, you may have issues alt+tabbing out of the game. Pressing 'END' to deactivate the program will allow you to tab out.


Scripts may not work as expected when on a slow system (low FPS in-game).

Everything may not work in free roam as it wasn't designed for this. It was DESIGNED FOR HEISTS IN MIND.

If downloaded, you hereby agree that I am not liable for any bans and you accept the consequences.

Thank yoooouuuuuu ❤️
